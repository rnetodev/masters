Delivery of financial market feeds requires massive data processing with ultra-low latency. FAST protocol is a financial technology standard for compressing data stream during network transmission. This paper presents the design and implementation of a hardware accelerator for financial market data in FAST protocol. We propose a parallel data decoding architecture for field analysis process, which is the key feature in our design. The decoder of this work is able to parse and filter FAST format messages, and with an additional parallel structure compared with typical handlers, achieving a 40{\%} speedup on decoding time compared to previous attempts. The filter function is reconfigurable for various user preferences and further protocol updates. Test under massive source data indicated an average latency of 1.6$\mu$s per message.",

    abstract = "Sentiment analysis from data streams is aimed at detecting authors‚Äô attitude, emotions and opinions from texts in real-time. To reduce the labeling effort needed in the data collection phase, active learning is often applied in streaming scenarios, where a learning algorithm is allowed to select new examples to be manually labeled in order to improve the learner‚Äôs performance. Even though there are many on-line platforms which perform sentiment analysis, there is no publicly available interactive on-line platform for dynamic adaptive sentiment analysis, which would be able to handle changes in data streams and adapt its behavior over time. This paper describes ClowdFlows, a cloud-based scientific workflow platform, and its extensions enabling the analysis of data streams and active learning. Moreover, by utilizing the data and workflow sharing in ClowdFlows, the labeling of examples can be distributed through crowdsourcing. The advanced features of ClowdFlows are demonstrated on a sentiment analysis use case, using active learning with a linear Support Vector Machine for learning sentiment classification models to be applied to microblogging data streams."
