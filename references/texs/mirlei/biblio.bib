abstract="Clustering time series is a problem that has applications in a wide variety of fields, and has recently attracted a large amount of research. Time series data are often large and may contain outliers. We show that the simple procedure of clipping the time series (discretising to above or below the median) reduces memory requirements and significantly speeds up clustering without decreasing clustering accuracy. We also demonstrate that clipping increases clustering accuracy when there are outliers in the data, thus serving as a means of outlier detection and a method of identifying model misspecification. We consider simulated data from polynomial, autoregressive moving average and hidden Markov models and show that the estimated parameters of the clipped data used in clustering tend, asymptotically, to those of the unclipped data. We also demonstrate experimentally that, if the series are long enough, the accuracy on clipped data is not significantly less than the accuracy on unclipped data, and if the series contain outliers then clipping results in significantly better clusterings. We then illustrate how using clipped series can be of practical benefit in detecting model misspecification and outliers on two real world data sets: an electricity generation bid data set and an ECG data set.",

There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. "

	abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the {\textquoteleft}empirical mode decomposition{\textquoteright} method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of {\textquoteleft}intrinsic mode functions{\textquoteright} that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the {\textquoteleft}instrinic mode functions{\textquoteright} yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of {\textquoteleft}intrinsic mode functions{\textquoteright} based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

The chaotic signals generated by Lorenz model as well as the observed monthly series of sunspots are, respectively, applied for simulation analysis, the experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of other methods.

By comparing the phase spectra of IMFs, we observed that a subset of them contains more stochastic influences while the other is predominantly deterministic. Considering this observation, we claim that \{IMFs\} can be combined to form two additive components: one deterministic and another stochastic. Having both components separated, researchers can improve data modeling as well as forecasting. In this context, this paper presents a new approach to separate deterministic from stochastic influences embedded in signals, considering the mutual information contained in phase spectra of consecutive IMFs. As previous step of this study, we also proved that \{EMD\} works as a filter bank. "

abstract="The most widely used measures of time series proximity are the Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping. The latter can be derived from the distance introduced by Maurice Fr{\'e}chet in 1906 to account for the proximity between curves. The major limitation of these proximity measures is that they are based on the closeness of the values regardless of the similarity w.r.t. the growth behavior of the time series. To alleviate this drawback we propose a new dissimilarity index, based on an automatic adaptive tuning function, to include both proximity measures w.r.t. values and w.r.t. behavior. A comparative numerical analysis between the proposed index and the classical distance measures is performed on the basis of two datasets: a synthetic dataset and a dataset from a public health study.",

With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using un-supervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.

abstract="Nowadays, with the advance of technology, many applications generate huge amounts of data streams at very high speed. Examples include network traffic, web click streams, video surveillance, and sensor networks. Data stream mining has become a hot research topic. Its goal is to extract hidden knowledge/patterns from continuous data streams. Unlike traditional data mining where the dataset is static and can be repeatedly read many times, data stream mining algorithms face many challenges and have to satisfy constraints such as bounded memory, single-pass, real-time response, and concept-drift detection. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art data stream mining algorithms with a focus on clustering and classification because of their ubiquitous usage. It identifies mining constraints, proposes a general model for data stream mining, and depicts the relationship between traditional data mining and data stream mining. Furthermore, it analyzes the advantages as well as limitations of data stream algorithms and suggests potential areas for future research.",
